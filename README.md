# Marriage-Event-Planner
Planning a marriage event involves managing numerous tasks, timelines, and vendor interactions. This complexity often necessitates a streamlined system to ensure the event runs smoothly. Our proposed solution is a Marriage Event Planner Application developed using ReactJS for the frontend and MongoDB for the backend database. This application aims to provide a user-friendly interface and robust functionality to handle the multifaceted aspects of wedding planning efficiently.

1. To provide an intuitive and responsive user interface for users to plan and manage wedding events.
2. To implement a robust backend system capable of storing and retrieving large volumes of data efficiently.
3. To facilitate seamless communication between users and vendors.
4. To enable real-time updates and notifications regarding the event planning progress.
