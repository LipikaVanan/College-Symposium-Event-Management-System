# COLLEGE SYMPOSIUM EVENT MANAGEMENT
Planning a college symposium event involves managing multiple tasks, schedules, and participant coordination. This complexity requires a well-organized system to ensure smooth execution. Our proposed solution is a College Event Management System, developed using ReactJS for the frontend and MongoDB for the backend database. This application provides a user-friendly interface and powerful features to efficiently handle various aspects of event planning and management.

1.To provide an intuitive and responsive user interface for students and administrators to plan and manage college events.
2.To implement a robust backend system capable of storing and retrieving large volumes of event-related data efficiently.
3.To facilitate seamless communication between students, organizers, and event coordinators.
4.To enable real-time updates and notifications regarding event schedules, changes, and participation details.
